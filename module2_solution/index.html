          When our kids are visiting Grandma, I make this recipe for 
          just my husband and myself. It's a recipe my mother-in-law 
          has been using for more than 30 years. I especially look 
          forward to preparing it as part of a special Valentine's Day 
          menu.

          Our food ingredients are mainly sourced from Tokyo, Hokkaido, 
          and Kyushu in Japan. We then delegate procurement personnel 
          in Japan to purchase the ingredients and have it directly 
          shipped to all our restaurants.
